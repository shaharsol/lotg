#### Problem
Developing apps that integrate with git providers (Github, bitbucket, gitlab) require separate integration with each one. 

#### Solution
One API to rule them all.
One npm package that generalizes integration with git providers. We can't get fully compatible with neither service. Let's get 80% compatible with all.
 
#### Goals:
- Create the basic package
- Implement at least one usecase (e.g. getUserRepos)
- Build a demo app that uses the package and demonstrate how it works against Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab without changing a sinle line of code (only configuration)
